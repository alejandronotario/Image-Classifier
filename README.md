## Overview

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

In this project, it is trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers using a dataset with 102 categories
